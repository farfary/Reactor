# Reactor üî•

A lightweight macOS menubar application for monitoring and managing system processes. Built with Swift, AppKit, and designed to run entirely from VS Code without requiring Xcode.

![Reactor Icon](https://via.placeholder.com/64x64/007ACC/FFFFFF?text=‚ö°)

## Features

- **üîç Live Process Menu**: View top CPU and memory consuming processes directly in the menubar dropdown
- **‚ö° Interactive Process Management**: Click on any process to terminate it with confirmation dialog
- **üîÑ Auto-Refresh**: Process list updates automatically when you open the menubar menu
- **üéØ Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, stays in your menubar
- **üåô System Integration**: Supports macOS dark mode and system preferences
- **üìä Visual Indicators**: High CPU processes are marked with üî• and moderate usage with ‚ö°
- **ÔøΩÔ∏è Safe Termination**: Uses SIGTERM first, then SIGKILL if needed for graceful process handling

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- macOS 12.0 or later
- Swift 5.8 or later
- VS Code (no Xcode required!)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone or Download**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   git clone <your-repo-url> Reactor
   # OR create the project directory manually
   mkdir Reactor && cd Reactor
   ```

2. **Copy the Project Files**
   - Copy all the files from this repository into your `~/Desktop/Reactor/` directory
   - Ensure the directory structure matches:
     ```
     Reactor/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package.swift
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sources/
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reactor/
             ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.swift
             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProcessMonitor.swift
     ```

3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/Reactor
   swift build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   swift run
   ```

### Alternative: Development Mode

For development and testing:

```bash
# Build in debug mode
swift build --configuration debug

# Run with verbose output
swift run --configuration debug
```

## Usage

1. **Launch**: Run `swift run` from the project directory
2. **Access**: Look for the ‚ö° bolt icon in your macOS menubar
3. **Monitor**: Click the icon to see the top 10 CPU-intensive processes listed directly in the dropdown menu
4. **Manage**: Click on any process in the list to terminate it (with confirmation dialog)
5. **Refresh**: The process list updates automatically each time you open the menu, or click "üîÑ Refresh Processes"

### Menu Features

- **Live Process List**: Top 10 processes sorted by CPU usage appear directly in the menu
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - üî• High CPU usage (>50%)
  - ‚ö° Moderate CPU usage (>20%)
- **Process Actions**: Click any process to kill it (with safety confirmation)
- **üîÑ Refresh Processes**: Manually refresh the process list
- **About Reactor**: Shows application information
- **Quit Reactor**: Closes the application

### Process Information Display

Each process shows:
- **Rank**: Position in CPU usage (1-10)
- **Process Name**: Cleaned, readable process name
- **CPU Usage**: Percentage of CPU being used
- **Memory Usage**: Percentage of system memory being used
- **PID**: Process ID (shown in tooltip)

## Development

### Project Structure

```
Reactor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package.swift              # Swift Package Manager configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sources/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reactor/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.swift         # App entry point and UI setup
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProcessMonitor.swift # Process monitoring and management logic
```

### Key Components

#### `main.swift`
- **AppDelegate**: Main application delegate handling menubar setup
- **Menu Construction**: Creates and manages the menubar menu
- **Event Handling**: Responds to user interactions

#### `ProcessMonitor.swift`
- **Process Listing**: Fetches and parses system process information
- **Process Management**: Handles process termination (SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Retrieves system memory statistics
- **Data Models**: Structures for process and memory information

### Building from VS Code

1. **Open Terminal in VS Code**: `View ‚Üí Terminal`
2. **Navigate to Project**: `cd ~/Desktop/Reactor`
3. **Build**: `swift build`
4. **Run**: `swift run`
5. **Debug**: Add print statements and rebuild

### Adding Features

To extend Reactor's functionality:

1. **Add Menu Items**: Modify `constructMenu()` in `main.swift`
2. **Extend ProcessMonitor**: Add new methods to `ProcessMonitor.swift`
3. **Handle Actions**: Create corresponding `@objc` methods in `AppDelegate`

Example: Adding a "Show Memory Usage" feature:

```swift
// In main.swift constructMenu()
let memoryItem = NSMenuItem(title: "Show Memory Usage", action: #selector(showMemoryUsage), keyEquivalent: "m")
memoryItem.target = self
menu.addItem(memoryItem)

// Add the action method
@objc func showMemoryUsage() {
    if let memInfo = processMonitor.getSystemMemoryInfo() {
        print("Memory Usage: \(String(format: "%.1f", memInfo.memoryUsagePercentage))%")
        print("Used: \(String(format: "%.2f", memInfo.usedMemoryGB))GB / \(String(format: "%.2f", memInfo.totalMemoryGB))GB")
    }
}
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **AppKit**: For menubar integration and UI components
- **Foundation**: For system process interaction and data handling

### System Commands Used
- `ps -axo pid,pcpu,pmem,comm --sort=-pcpu`: Process listing
- `kill -TERM <pid>`: Graceful process termination
- `kill -9 <pid>`: Force process termination
- `vm_stat`: Memory statistics

### Performance
- Minimal CPU usage when idle
- Process queries on-demand only
- No background polling or timers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found: swift"**
- Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

**"Permission denied" when killing processes**
- Some system processes require admin privileges
- Try running with `sudo swift run` (not recommended for regular use)

**App doesn't appear in menubar**
- Check terminal output for error messages
- Ensure macOS version compatibility (12.0+)

**Build errors**
- Verify all files are in the correct directory structure
- Check Swift version: `swift --version`

### Debug Mode

Run with debug output:
```bash
swift run --configuration debug
```
